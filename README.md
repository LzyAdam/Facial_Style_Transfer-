# Facial_Style_Transfer-
Algorithm Design and System Implementation for Facial Style Transfer                               Sept 2020 -May 2021 
•	Proposed two new algorithms of style transfer gain and three transfer algorithms separately for oil painting, abstract painting, and pencil drawing styles, which were implemented in MATLAB to improve the beauty result 
•	Achieved multi-frequency gain transfer that can produce better facial style transfer effects than Prisma by highlighting oil painting texture and reducing background color interference
•	Improved the multi-frequency gain analysis method in MATLAB to apply the style transfer method
